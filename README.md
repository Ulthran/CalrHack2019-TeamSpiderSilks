# CalrHack2019-TeamSpiderSilks

YES! We misspelled Carl! But our project looks better than our repo title.

This project by Team Spider Silks is an organizational and analytical tool for OIIL and Carleton students to see trends in campus wide scheduling. The tool scrapes the campus calendar (https://apps.carleton.edu/calendar/) day by day, event by event for event details and then moves those details into a Google calendar. We also provide some backend tools for analysis and visualization of the data.

How to theoretically run this program:

As of right now, our code will not scrape all the information from Carleton's calendar website in a readable format. However, it almost does (right now, we've got about 50% of it good), so we took the time to manually get rid of all of the nasties so you would have the chance to see what our program does. Our program will take data from the Carleton website, move it to an excel sheet (we've included our own that actually works), then upload it to a google calendar where it can be viewed. Run the CalendarBuilder.py file, sign in with a dummy account (we've been using U:theCarletonCalendar@gmail.com P:Schiller123), and watch the calendar fill up with every even from the month of April.
