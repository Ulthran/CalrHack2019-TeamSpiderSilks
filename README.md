# CalrHack2019-TeamSpiderSilks

YES! We misspelled Carl! But our project looks better than our repo title.

This project by Team Spider Silks is an organizational and analytical tool for OIIL and Carleton students to see trends in campus wide scheduling. The tool scrapes the campus calendar (https://apps.carleton.edu/calendar/) day by day, event by event for event details and then moves those details into a Google calendar. We also provide some backend tools for analysis and visualization of the data.
